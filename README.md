If you find a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/oxygen-dioxide/hitsuboku-kumi-chn/issues/new) to report it.

## Why this project?
In hitsuboku Kumi chinese voicebank, voices of different pitches are recorded into one file, which prevents moresampler from correctly calculate the fundamental frequency. Here I split the audio files into different pitches.

## Tech Specs
- 4 pitches (A3, D4, A4, D5)
- using Voicemith reclist
